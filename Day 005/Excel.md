### 1) What is the difference between a relative, absolute, and mixed cell reference in Excel?

- **Relative Cell Reference**:
  - Adjusts when the formula is copied to another cell.
  - Example: `A1` changes to `B1` if copied one column to the right.
  - Usage: Most common for general calculations that need to adjust based on the position.

- **Absolute Cell Reference**:
  - Does not change when the formula is copied to another cell.
  - Example: `$A$1` remains `$A$1` regardless of where it is copied.
  - Usage: Useful for constants or fixed values that should not change with formula replication.

- **Mixed Cell Reference**:
  - Contains a combination of relative and absolute references.
  - Example: `$A1` (absolute column, relative row) or `A$1` (relative column, absolute row).
  - Usage: Useful when you want to fix either the row or column while allowing the other to change.

### 2) How do you use the VLOOKUP function? Provide an example.

**VLOOKUP** is used to search for a value in the first column of a range and return a value in the same row from a specified column.

**Syntax**:
```excel
VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
```

- `lookup_value`: The value to search for.
- `table_array`: The range containing the data.
- `col_index_num`: The column number in the range from which to return the value.
- `range_lookup`: Optional. `TRUE` for an approximate match, `FALSE` for an exact match.

**Example**:
```excel
=VLOOKUP("John", A2:D10, 3, FALSE)
```
This searches for "John" in the first column of the range `A2:D10` and returns the value from the third column of the matching row.

### 3) What is the INDEX and MATCH function, and how do they work together?

**INDEX** and **MATCH** are used together to perform lookups that VLOOKUP can't handle, such as looking up a value to the left or more complex criteria.

- **INDEX** returns the value of a cell in a specified row and column from a range.
  **Syntax**:
  ```excel
  INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num])
  ```

- **MATCH** searches for a value in a range and returns the relative position of that value.
  **Syntax**:
  ```excel
  MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])
  ```

**Example**:
```excel
=INDEX(B2:B10, MATCH("John", A2:A10, 0))
```
This finds the row where "John" is located in `A2:A10` and then returns the value from the same row in the range `B2:B10`.

### 4) How do you use the SUMIF and SUMIFS functions?

- **SUMIF** adds the values in a range that meet a single condition.
  **Syntax**:
  ```excel
  SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])
  ```

  **Example**:
  ```excel
  =SUMIF(A2:A10, ">100", B2:B10)
  ```
  This sums the values in `B2:B10` where the corresponding values in `A2:A10` are greater than 100.

- **SUMIFS** adds the values in a range that meet multiple conditions.
  **Syntax**:
  ```excel
  SUMIFS(sum_range, criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2], ...)
  ```

  **Example**:
  ```excel
  =SUMIFS(B2:B10, A2:A10, ">100", C2:C10, "John")
  ```
  This sums the values in `B2:B10` where the values in `A2:A10` are greater than 100 and the corresponding values in `C2:C10` are "John".

### 5) What is the difference between COUNT, COUNTA, COUNTBLANK, and COUNTIF functions?

- **COUNT**:
  - Counts the number of cells that contain numbers.
  - **Example**:
    ```excel
    =COUNT(A1:A10)
    ```
    Counts the number of cells in the range `A1:A10` that contain numeric values.

- **COUNTA**:
  - Counts the number of cells that are not empty, regardless of the type of data.
  - **Example**:
    ```excel
    =COUNTA(A1:A10)
    ```
    Counts the number of non-empty cells in the range `A1:A10`.

- **COUNTBLANK**:
  - Counts the number of empty cells.
  - **Example**:
    ```excel
    =COUNTBLANK(A1:A10)
    ```
    Counts the number of empty cells in the range `A1:A10`.

- **COUNTIF**:
  - Counts the number of cells that meet a single condition.
  - **Example**:
    ```excel
    =COUNTIF(A1:A10, ">100")
    ```
    Counts the number of cells in the range `A1:A10` that have values greater than 100.

```excel
IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)
```

**Example**:
```excel
=IF(A1 > 100, "High", "Low")
```
This returns "High" if the value in `A1` is greater than 100, otherwise it returns "Low".

**Nested IF Statements**:
Nested `IF` statements are used when you need to evaluate multiple conditions.

**Example**:
```excel
=IF(A1 > 100, "High", IF(A1 > 50, "Medium", "Low"))
```
This checks if `A1` is greater than 100; if not, it checks if `A1` is greater than 50, and otherwise, it returns "Low".
